    &#34;I just want to say a very big thank you to you for the wonderfully sensitive
    way in which you conducted my mother's funeral service last week.  It was
    a beautiful ceremony and you made what was an incredibly difficult day for us
    all, so meaningful. Your support gave us the courage to deliver our tributes
    without breaking down.  I think Mum would have loved every minute.</br>

    My poor dad is inevitably struggling to carry on and after spending 72 years
    of his life with Mum, it is not surprising.  He is very sad and tells me that
    he won't be around for much longer.  I think he just can't imagine life
    without her.  He did, however, really appreciate the ceremony and sends his
    thanks.&#34;</br>

    With our gratitude and best wishes
